# Onboarding Design

## What This Skill Produces
- Onboarding flow specifications
- Screen-by-screen copy and UX
- Activation metric definitions
- Re-engagement sequences

## User Input Required
Provide brief context (3-5 sentences):
- What product is this for?
- Who is the target user?
- What's the core value/aha moment?

## Embedded Wisdom: Time to Value

### Sean Ellis on Activation

"Ultimately, it's about trying to get as many of the right people to experience the product in a way where they'd be very disappointed if they could no longer use the product."

"In my experience, the hardest part really sits inside the product team - how do you shape that first user experience so they actually use it in the right way and it's not so difficult that they give up?"

"Until you get them to that must-have experience, they're at their highest risk of being lost. And so a lot of people focus on 'Well, I better get their email address or phone number.' But then you're essentially having to reacquire them. If you can collapse that time to value..."

**Key Principle**: The goal of onboarding is to get users to the "very disappointed" state as fast as possible.

### Merci Grace (Slack) on First Impressions

"How you introduce something, how you frame something matters a lot. How will someone discover this? And so if you can think about an online product from that first introduction - 'What will it be like for someone to come in here? What will I be asking them to upload, to invite someone else? What are the steps between the user and the full value of your app?' - is something that's very useful to think about literally from the first days that you're designing the product."

"I would design the game from the onboarding experience. There wasn't a sense of 'here's the game and all the game dynamics' separate from 'here's how you introduce it.' The introduction IS the product."

## Embedded Wisdom: Personalization at Signup

### Archie Abrams (Shopify) on Collecting Information

"Going back, there's an enormous amount of value in the nuts and bolts of sign up, collecting the right information. And you usually want to collect more information than most people think you do in your sign up flow. If you can then leverage that to personalize the guidance."

"Shopify is a very diverse product - in-person selling, online selling, different channels. Whether you're coming to sell crafts or run an enterprise, the guidance someone gets when they onboard matters. So collecting information to personalize that guidance has shown long-term effects."

### Laura Schaffer (Twilio) on Signup Questions

"We put questions into the signup flow and I was fully expecting 'This is going to hurt our numbers, but maybe it won't be so bad.' We start to get the data... I'm not kidding, it improved conversion by 5%. Just the questions, no personalization yet."

"Users appreciated being asked. It showed we cared about getting them to the right place."

**Key Pattern**: Asking questions can INCREASE conversion, not decrease it, if the questions signal you'll personalize their experience.

## Embedded Wisdom: Emotional Framing

### Adam Fishman on User Psychology

"Most people come to your product with an emotional frame and a lot of people want to appeal to their logical brain right away. Don't do that. You have to understand the mindset that people are in. How low are their lows? How high are their highs? Why are they seeking out your product? It often stems from some emotional challenge. Only when you address that can you move on to the logical features."

**Application to Onboarding**:
1. First, acknowledge their emotional state (why they're here)
2. Then, show them you understand their goal
3. Only then, introduce features/functionality
4. Lead with benefits, not features

## Embedded Wisdom: Game Design Principles

### Merci Grace on Game-Based Onboarding

"I would design the game from the onboarding experience. There wasn't a sense of 'here's exactly the game' separate from 'here's how you introduce it.'"

**Game Design Principles for Onboarding**:

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Don't show everything at once
   - Introduce one concept at a time
   - Unlock features as users demonstrate mastery

2. **Quick Win**: Give users a win in the first session
   - Even a small accomplishment builds momentum
   - Make the first task completable in under 2 minutes

3. **Clear Goals**: Users should always know what to do next
   - Progress indicators
   - Clear CTAs
   - "You're X steps away from [goal]"

4. **Immediate Feedback**: Every action should have visible response
   - Celebrate completions
   - Show progress
   - Confirm successful actions

## Embedded Wisdom: Activation Metrics

### Defining Your Activation Metric

**Sean Ellis Framework**:
"Figure out a metric that essentially captures units of value being delivered. That's what a north star metric is - something that reflects how many people are experiencing that product-market fit experience."

**Good Activation Metrics**:
- Tied to the "aha moment" action
- Measurable within first 7-14 days
- Correlates with long-term retention
- Actionable (team can influence it)

**Examples by Product Type**:

| Product Type | Activation Metric |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Social app | Added X friends in first week |
| SaaS tool | Completed core workflow once |
| Marketplace | First transaction completed |
| Content app | Consumed X pieces of content |
| Productivity | Created first [artifact] |

### Albert Cheng (Duolingo) on Retention Focus

"Current user retention rate was the biggest thing for them. Especially if you have a product with daily frequency, that's the retention that matters most - your existing user base that has developed a habitual pattern. How sticky is your product? That retention rate really compounds."

## Onboarding Patterns by Product Type

### Consumer App Onboarding

**Pattern**: Quick value, minimal friction
- Skip account creation until necessary
- Show value before asking for commitment
- Social proof early (X people using this)
- Make first session completable in <3 minutes

**Duolingo Example**:
- Starts with a lesson immediately (no signup required)
- Shows progress and streak potential
- Only asks for account after you've experienced value
- Gamification hooks (XP, levels) visible from start

### B2B/SaaS Onboarding

**Pattern**: Guided setup, personalized path
- Collect role/use case information
- Provide templates/starting points
- Checklist with progress indicators
- Offer human help for high-value users

**Shopify Example**:
- Asks about business type upfront
- Customizes dashboard based on answers
- Checklist: "7 steps to launch your store"
- Progress saved across sessions

### Marketplace Onboarding

**Pattern**: Different flows for each side
- Supply side: Focus on listing creation
- Demand side: Focus on first successful match
- Reduce friction to first transaction

### EdTech Onboarding

**Pattern**: Assessment → Personalized path
- Quick assessment to understand level
- Personalized curriculum/recommendations
- Early win (complete first lesson successfully)
- Show progress toward goal

## Re-engagement Patterns

### Users Who Don't Complete Onboarding

**Timing Pattern**:
| Trigger | Timing | Channel | Focus |
|---------|--------|---------|-------|
| Incomplete signup | +4 hours | Email | Remove friction, answer questions |
| Started but stopped | +1 day | Email/Push | Remind of progress, next step |
| No return after signup | +3 days | Email | Re-explain value, new angle |
| Still inactive | +7 days | Email | Social proof, case study |

**Message Framework**:
- Don't just say "come back"
- Remind them of their goal (why they signed up)
- Show what they're missing / could achieve
- Make the next step crystal clear

### Adam Fishman on Revisiting Onboarding

"I very strongly dislike redesigning something for redesigning sake. It's acceptable to revisit onboarding when you are learning net new principles about your customers or something new about your growth model. As we learned at Patreon what the right tier construction was, we would go back and say, 'How do we build this newfound knowledge into an experience that sets someone up for success?'"
