# Product Discovery

## What This Skill Produces
- Product discovery briefs with problem/solution hypotheses
- Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) analysis
- Target user profiles with "must-have" criteria
- Validation plans with specific methods and success criteria

## User Input Required
Provide brief context (3-5 sentences):
- What product/feature are you exploring?
- Who is the target user?
- What problem are you trying to solve?

Example: "Building an AI tutor for K-12 students. Target: parents who want to help kids with homework. Problem: kids struggle with math and parents can't explain concepts well."

## Embedded Wisdom: Jobs to Be Done Framework

### Bob Moesta's Complete JTBD Methodology

**Core Philosophy**
"Jobs to Be Done research is hypothesis BUILDING research. We really don't know, that's the point. There's way more unknown than there is known - never forget it."

**The Biggest Misconception**
"One of the biggest misconceptions around Jobs to Be Done is this notion that it's pain and gain as opposed to context and outcome. It's purely about the outcome and not just about the context and outcome together."

Wrong approach: Ask "What's your pain point?"
Right approach: Ask "What was happening in your life when you started looking for a solution? What outcome were you trying to achieve?"

### The Six Phases of Customer Decision

When someone decides to use a new product, they go through these phases. For any product, map what happens at each:

**1. First Thought**
The moment something triggers awareness that change might be needed.
- What event makes someone first think about this problem?
- Example (home buying): "The old house had 280,000 miles... three large repair bills in four months"
- Example (career): "I got passed over for a promotion and realized I needed to change something"

**2. Passive Looking**
Casually noticing alternatives without actively searching.
- What do they notice in passing? What catches their attention?
- They're not searching yet, but they're more aware of solutions when they see them

**3. Active Looking**
Deliberately searching for solutions.
- What search terms? Where do they look? Who do they ask?
- This is when they compare options and do research

**4. Deciding**
Comparing and choosing between options.
- What tradeoffs do they actually make vs. what they say they'd make?
- Critical insight: "93% said they wanted Energy Star compliance. Nobody bought it. They all bought the finished basement."
- What people say they want ≠ what they actually choose

**5. First Use**
Initial experience with the new product.
- What does success look like in the first session?
- What anxiety exists about the switch?

**6. Ongoing Use**
Building habits around the new solution.
- What makes this sticky?
- What would make them "very disappointed" to lose it?

### The Four Forces of Progress

People don't randomly switch products. Four forces determine whether they'll change:

**Push Forces (Away from current situation)**
- F1: Push of the situation - problems with current solution
- "The push has nothing to do with the new product - it's the only reason why they would leave the old product"
- If there's no push, they can't even see your product because "we're creatures of habit"

**Pull Forces (Toward new solution)**
- F2: Pull of the new solution - magnetism of what's possible
- The imagined better outcome or state

**Resistance Forces (Blocking change)**
- F3: Anxiety of the new - fear of the unknown, switching costs
- F4: Habit of the present - comfort with current way, even if imperfect
- "There's a waterline... these forces often keep people from making progress"

**Application**: For your product to win, Push + Pull must exceed Anxiety + Habit.

### The Layers of Language

Surface answers hide real motivations. In research, dig through these layers:

**Layer 1 - Pablum**: Surface non-answers
- "I wanted a better product" / "It seemed like a good deal"
- This tells you nothing useful - keep digging

**Layer 2 - Rational**: Logical explanations
- "It saves me time" / "It's more efficient"
- Better, but still not the real motivation

**Layer 3 - Emotional**: Feelings driving behavior
- "I was embarrassed to ask for help" / "I felt stuck"
- Getting warmer - this reveals actual motivation

**Layer 4 - True Cause**: Core underlying need
- "I need to prove I can handle this myself" / "I want my kids to see me as capable"
- This is what actually drives purchase decisions

**Technique**: "In first 5 minutes, users give pablum. Real insights come from asking 'tell me more' and 'why was that important?' repeatedly."

"So for example, in the first five minutes of an interview, they're going to tell you, 'I bought a new car because I got a deal on it and it was a car I've been dreaming about forever.' But when you start to dig, it's no - the old car had 280,000 miles, three large repair bills in the last four months, and a long trip coming up. That's why they bought a car. Not because of the deal."

### Three Types of Jobs

For any product, identify all three:

**Functional Job**: The practical task they're trying to accomplish
- What are they literally trying to do?
- EdTech example: "Help my child understand fractions"
- B2B example: "Create reports for my manager faster"

**Emotional Job**: How they want to feel
- What emotional state are they seeking?
- EdTech example: "Feel like a competent parent who supports education"
- B2B example: "Feel confident presenting to leadership"

**Social Job**: How they want to be perceived by others
- How do they want others to see them?
- EdTech example: "Be seen as an engaged parent by teachers"
- B2B example: "Be seen as a high performer by my team"

## Embedded Wisdom: Product-Market Fit Measurement

### Sean Ellis's PMF Test (Complete Methodology)

**The Survey Question**
Ask users who have experienced your core value:
"How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?"
- Very disappointed
- Somewhat disappointed
- Not disappointed
- N/A (no longer use)

**The 40% Threshold**
"Trying to get as many people to experience the product in a way where they'd be very disappointed if they could no longer use the product."

- <25% very disappointed: Major pivot needed. Core value prop isn't landing.
- 25-40% very disappointed: Getting closer. Iterate on activation and core experience.
- 40%+ very disappointed: PMF signal achieved. Focus on growth and scaling.

**Who to Survey**
Only survey users who have experienced the core value - not just people who signed up. Someone who signed up but never used the key feature hasn't really experienced your product.

**Real Example - Lookout (Mobile Security)**
"I dug into the 7% who said they'd be very disappointed and found most were focused on the antivirus functionality. They know they need to protect their computer from viruses, smartphones were becoming more like computers. That told us what to double down on."

**Follow-up Questions** (for the "very disappointed" segment):
1. What would you use as an alternative if this didn't exist?
2. What is the primary benefit you get from using this?
3. What type of person do you think would benefit most from this?
4. How can we improve this for you?

**Building the Flywheel**
"Step one: understand what makes it must-have. Step two: figure out a metric that captures units of that value being delivered. That's what a north star metric is - something that reflects how many people are experiencing that product-market fit experience."

## Embedded Wisdom: Validation Methods

### Validation Hierarchy (Cheapest to Most Expensive)

**From Jen Abel**: "You don't even need to talk about the solution. If someone reached out with a novel insight about a problem, you'd probably reply."

**Level 1: Problem Validation (Hours)**
- Cold outreach focused on problem insight, not solution
- "The big takeaway: if you get any sales email, the primary focus is usually 'here's what we do.' But if someone reached out with a novel insight about a problem you're focused on, you'd probably reply."
- Success metric: Response rate, willingness to talk more

**Level 2: Demand Signals (Days)**
- Landing page with waitlist
- Fake door test (button/feature that tracks clicks but doesn't exist yet)
- "The biggest risk is: do people even want this thing? Test that on a landing page before building anything."
- Success metric: Signup rate, click-through rate

**Level 3: Manual Delivery (Weeks)**
- Concierge MVP: Deliver value manually, human-powered
- Wizard of Oz: Looks automated but is actually manual behind the scenes
- "Can we deliver the value, even if it doesn't scale?"
- Success metric: Would users pay? Would they be very disappointed without it?

**Level 4: Product Build (Months)**
- Build minimum viable product
- Only proceed after Levels 1-3 show signal
- Success metric: 40%+ "very disappointed" on PMF survey

### Design Sprint Validation (Jake Knapp)

"The team is going to say, 'What are the biggest risks that this hypothesis is not true? What do we need to assess right now?' Going to make a map of how customers discover the product, what that core experience looks like, and then figure out where's the key moment for assessing that risk."

"For one startup, the biggest risk was: do people even want this thing? Will these artisans want a community sales platform? They decided the key moment to test was actually on the landing page - before building anything."

## Embedded Examples by Product Type

### Consumer Apps

**Airbnb Discovery**
- Struggling moment (Hosts): Had unused space + needed extra income
- Struggling moment (Guests): Hotels expensive, wanted authentic local experience
- Functional job: Find/offer accommodation
- Emotional job: Hosts feel entrepreneurial; Guests feel like locals, not tourists
- Validation approach: Founders became first hosts, took professional photos to prove concept

**Tinder Discovery**
- Found "whales" (high spenders) weren't rich people flaunting wealth
- They were lonely people willing to pay for connection
- "Our hypothesis was these must be high net worth people... totally wrong"
- Lesson: Dig past surface explanations to find real motivation

**Duolingo Discovery**
- Struggling moment: Want to learn language but courses expensive/time-consuming/boring
- Key insight: Gamification makes learning feel less like work
- Functional job: Learn a language
- Emotional job: Feel accomplished, make progress daily
- Social job: Share streaks, prove commitment to learning

### B2B/SaaS

**Slack Discovery**
- Struggling moment: Email overload for quick team communication
- Discovered through own pain building a video game (Glitch)
- Functional job: Quick team communication without email overhead
- Emotional job: Feel connected to team, not overwhelmed by inbox
- Product emerged from internal tool solving their own problem

**Figma Discovery**
- Struggling moment: Designers couldn't collaborate in real-time
- Had to email files back and forth, version control nightmare
- "We found designers wanted to work together like Google Docs"
- Functional job: Design collaboratively
- Emotional job: Feel alignment with team, reduce revision cycles

### EdTech / Learning Products

**Common Struggling Moments**:
- Child failed a test, parent feels helpless
- Homework deadline approaching, kid is stuck
- Parent doesn't understand modern teaching methods
- Child falling behind peers, parent anxious

**Common Jobs**:
- Functional: Help child understand specific concept
- Emotional: Feel like a competent, supportive parent
- Social: Demonstrate engagement to teachers, other parents

**Validation Approach for EdTech**:
1. Interview parents who recently hired tutors - why?
2. Interview parents who tried learning apps - what worked/didn't?
3. Landing page test: Does the problem statement resonate?
4. Manual tutoring (concierge): Can you deliver the value in person?

### Marketplaces

**Key Discovery Questions for Marketplaces**:
- Why would supply join? What's their struggling moment?
- Why would demand come? What alternatives exist?
- What's the "chicken and egg" - which side do you solve first?
- What's the minimum viable liquidity?

## How to Apply This Wisdom

### Step 1: Identify the Struggling Moment
Using the Six Phases framework, work backwards from your target user:
- What context are they in when they first think about this problem?
- What's the "push" that makes today different from yesterday?

### Step 2: Map the Three Jobs
For your specific user:
- What functional task are they trying to accomplish?
- How do they want to feel after?
- How do they want others to perceive them?

### Step 3: Understand the Four Forces
For your product to win:
- What's pushing them away from current solutions?
- What's pulling them toward your solution?
- What anxiety exists about switching?
- What habits keep them with the current way?

### Step 4: Design Validation
Start at the cheapest level that can answer your riskiest hypothesis:
- If problem is unvalidated → Level 1 (problem interviews)
- If demand is unknown → Level 2 (landing page)
- If solution is untested → Level 3 (concierge)
- If scale is unproven → Level 4 (MVP)
