# User Research

## What This Skill Produces
- Interview guides and protocols
- Survey designs
- Research synthesis reports
- User insight documentation

## User Input Required
Provide brief context (3-5 sentences):
- What decision does this research need to inform?
- Who are you researching?
- What do you need to learn?

## Embedded Wisdom: Research Philosophy

### Bob Moesta on Interview Technique

"In the first five minutes of an interview, they're going to tell you 'I bought a new car because I got a deal on it and it was a car I've been dreaming about forever.' But when you start to dig, it's no - the old car had 280,000 miles, three large repair bills in the last four months, and a long trip coming up. That's why they bought a car. Not because of the deal."

**Key Principle**: Surface answers hide real motivations. Your job is to dig deeper.

### Judd Antin on Research Anti-Patterns

"A researcher who's going to ask customers what they want is a bad researcher. You need a different researcher."

**The Henry Ford Problem**: "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses."

**Better Approach**: Don't ask what they want. Ask about:
- What they've done (behavior)
- Why they did it (motivation)
- What frustrated them (pain)
- What they were trying to accomplish (goal)

### Nicole Forsgren on Listening

"Honestly, the best thing you can do is go talk to people and listen. Start with listening, not with tools and automation. So many times companies are like, 'I'm just going to build this tool' when they should ask: 'Walk me through what you did yesterday. What were the points that were delightful? What were the points that were really difficult? Where did you get frustrated? Where was there friction?'"

## Embedded Wisdom: The Layers of Language

### Bob Moesta's Digging Technique

When users give surface answers, dig through the layers:

**Layer 1 - Pablum** (Surface non-answers)
- "It seemed like a good choice"
- "I liked the features"
- Response: "Tell me more about that. What specifically?"

**Layer 2 - Rational** (Logical explanations)
- "It saves me time"
- "It's more efficient"
- Response: "Why is that important to you?"

**Layer 3 - Emotional** (Feelings driving behavior)
- "I was frustrated with..."
- "I felt stuck..."
- Response: "What made you feel that way? What were you worried about?"

**Layer 4 - True Cause** (Core underlying need)
- "I needed to prove I could handle this"
- "I wanted my team to see me as capable"
- Response: You've found the real motivation

### Digging Questions
- "Tell me more about that."
- "What do you mean by [term they used]?"
- "Why was that important to you?"
- "What were you worried about?"
- "Walk me through exactly what happened."
- "What would have happened if you hadn't done that?"

## Embedded Wisdom: Balancing Signals

### Yuhki Yamashita (Figma) on Signal Balance

"It's really important to balance out the vocal minority with what's actually happening. I view tweets and complaints more as canaries in the coal mine - inputs into many inputs we have around everything our customers could be experiencing."

"We have certain forums like support tickets where customers tend to be much more dissatisfied. And we have other inputs like sales conversations that are more about perceptions. It's important to have this balanced portfolio of different kinds of feedback to know you don't have any blind spots."

### Signal Sources

| Source | Bias | Best For |
|--------|------|----------|
| Support tickets | Problems, complaints | Understanding friction |
| Sales conversations | Prospects, perceptions | Market positioning |
| Social media | Vocal minority | Early warning signals |
| Usage data | Silent majority | Actual behavior |
| User interviews | Deeper understanding | Motivation, context |
| Surveys | Broader validation | Quantifying insights |

## Embedded Wisdom: Research Types

### Hypothesis-Building vs. Hypothesis-Testing

**Bob Moesta**: "Jobs to Be Done research is hypothesis BUILDING research. We really don't know, that's the point."

| Type | Purpose | Methods |
|------|---------|---------|
| Hypothesis-Building | Discover what's true | Open-ended interviews, observation |
| Hypothesis-Testing | Validate what you think | Surveys, A/B tests, usability tests |

**Common Mistake**: Using hypothesis-testing methods (surveys) when you need hypothesis-building (interviews).

### Research Method Selection

| Question Type | Best Method |
|--------------|-------------|
| "What do users actually do?" | Analytics, observation |
| "Why do they do it?" | Interviews |
| "How many feel this way?" | Survey |
| "Can they use this?" | Usability test |
| "Will they choose this?" | A/B test, fake door |

## Interview Best Practices

### Before the Interview

**Recruit the Right People**:
- Recent behavior (did the thing in last X days)
- Relevant context (matches your target user)
- Diverse perspectives (don't just talk to fans)

**Avoid**:
- Friends and family (too biased)
- Only happy customers (survivorship bias)
- People who haven't experienced the problem

### During the Interview

**Opening** (Build rapport, set expectations)
- Thank them for their time
- Explain the purpose (learning, not selling)
- Clarify there are no right/wrong answers
- Ask permission to record

**Warm-up** (Ease into the conversation)
- Tell me about your role/situation
- Walk me through a typical day
- General questions before specific

**Core Questions** (Get to the real insights)
- Focus on PAST behavior, not future intentions
- "Tell me about the last time you..."
- Follow up on interesting threads
- Use the layers of language technique

**Probing** (Dig deeper)
- "Tell me more about that"
- "What do you mean by [term]?"
- "Why was that important?"
- "What were you worried about?"

**Closing**
- Is there anything I didn't ask that I should have?
- Who else should I talk to?
- Can I follow up if I have more questions?

### After the Interview

**Immediately**:
- Write down key insights while fresh
- Note surprising findings
- Flag quotes to use

**Synthesis**:
- Look for patterns across interviews
- Identify themes, not just individual opinions
- Distinguish between universal and segment-specific insights

## Survey Best Practices

### When to Use Surveys

**Good for**:
- Quantifying qualitative findings
- Reaching large numbers
- Measuring attitudes at scale
- Tracking changes over time

**Bad for**:
- Discovery (use interviews first)
- Understanding "why" (need follow-up)
- Complex topics (keep it simple)

### Survey Design Principles

**Keep it Short**:
- Every question reduces completion rate
- 5-10 questions ideal
- Under 5 minutes to complete

**Question Types**:
| Type | Best For | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| Single choice | Clear categories | "What's your primary role?" |
| Multiple choice | All-that-apply | "Which features do you use?" |
| Scale (1-5) | Intensity/agreement | "How satisfied are you?" |
| Open text | Unexpected insights | "What's your biggest challenge?" |

**Avoid**:
- Leading questions ("Don't you think X is great?")
- Double-barreled questions (asking two things at once)
- Jargon (use their language)
- Hypotheticals ("Would you use X?" - unreliable)

## Synthesis Framework

### From Data to Insights

**Step 1: Gather**
- Review all notes, recordings, quotes
- Don't filter yet - capture everything

**Step 2: Cluster**
- Group similar observations together
- Look for patterns and themes
- Name each cluster

**Step 3: Analyze**
- What's surprising vs. expected?
- What contradicts our assumptions?
- What's universal vs. segment-specific?

**Step 4: Synthesize**
- Turn clusters into insights
- Insight format: "Users [behavior] because [motivation], which means [implication]"

**Step 5: Recommend**
- What should we do with this knowledge?
- What decisions does this inform?

- "What do you mean by [term]?"
- "Walk me through exactly what happened"
- "Why was that important to you?"
- "What would have happened if you hadn't done that?"
- "How did that make you feel?"
